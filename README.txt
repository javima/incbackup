1.- DESCRIPTION

This is a Bash script to automate the incremental backup process using rsync. The backups are made on a host using as source and destination local folders. Is is possible to make backup of remote filesystems or in remote filesystems by mounting them as local folders (this is automated by the script). Incremental backups are kept in different folders numbered 1, 2, 3, ... (1 is the oldest copy)

The number of incremental backups may or may not be limited. If a limit is set, when it is reached, the older copy will be deleted and backup folders (1, 2, 3, ...) will be renumbered from 1 (folder 1 will be always the older one). In addition, there will always be a link called "last" that points to the newest backup.

The script always repairs, in a transparent manner, the numbering of backup folders if needed (missing numbers, etc). If the maximum backup limit changes, and is set a lower number than existing copies, then the script deletes the older ones and makes renumeration as expected.

In general, it is possible to change the configuration file yet existing older backups. Changes will affect future backups, remaining unchanged the older ones (until they could be deleted when the backup limit is reached).

Incremental backups are maded with hard links, saving space.

The use is very simple: the parameter of the script is a single bash file with some configuration aspects. In this way, you can have different backup configurations simultaneously.

In the explanations that follow, it is assumed that the package files are in /home/usuario/bin/incbackup

3.- INSTALL

This package can be used without any specific installation. Neverthless, it would be useful to put it accesible to the whole system and automatice backups. This requires to do this steps:

1.- Include the folder that contains the package to the system PATH:
    - Edit incbackup_profile.sh and change the path
    - Copy incbackup_profile.sh in /etc/profile.d
    For this to take effect to root user, you must modify the system PATH in /etc/bashrc

2.- Modify the cron system to automatice backups (see examples below):
    - Option 1: modify crontab
        For a diary backup at 13:30
          30 13 * * * root nice -n 19 incbackup.sh incbackup_config1.sh
        If the system PATH has not been modified, then do this:
          30 13 * * * root nice -n 19 /home/usuario/bin/incbackup/incbackup.sh /home/usuario/bin/incbackup/incbackup_config1.sh
    - Option 2: add execution script to cron.daily
        Edit incbackup_crondaily and change the path/name of files
        Give execution permission:
          chmod a+x incbackup_daily
        Copy incbackup_daily to /etc/cron.daily/
    
    In the first case, if at the time when it should be done the backup the computer is off, the backup will not be made. In the second case, if computer is off during several days, the backup will be made at the first boot.

****************************************************
4.- USE

To use the script you must set only one parameter: a configuration file. The format of this file is described below:

1.- Target of the backup (only one)
    This will be a folder mounted on the host computer. You must set two variables:
      DESTINO_FS   Name of the folder in which the filesystem is mounted (to make backup inside)
      DESTINO_DIR  Folder, inside DESTINO_FS, in which the backup will be done
    That is, once the silesystem is mounted, the backup will be done into DESTINO_FS/DESTINO_DIR
    DESTINO_FS can be a local drive or a network drive. The script will check if it is mounted and, if it isn't mounted then it will mount it.
    To mount the target folder, it can be configured if the mounting process should be done by the /etc/fstab configuration or, conversely, the target can be named by his volume name. The value of DESTINO_ETQ will be FSTAB if mounting is done through /etc/fstab configuration. In the case the value is not FSTAB, then it will be assumed that it is the volume name.
    In some cases, rsync can't keep the owner/group of files (i.e. if the target filesystem is SSHFS mounted and the remote user is not the root user, etc). In this case you must set DESTINO_OWNER=NO. Otherwise set DESTINO_OWNER=YES. Both options should work in the same way but rsync warning messages about the impossibility to make chown over files will be skipped.

2.- Sources of the copy (one or more)
      ORIGEN   List of folders to backup
    Each entry in the list must contain:
      - the path to backup
      - MOUNT/LOCAL. If MOUNT is used, then the source filesystem will be mounted through his /etc/fstab entry. If LOCAL is used, it is assumed that the filesystem doesn't need to be mounted. This facilitates the backup of remote drives through the host computer.
      - filename used by the --exclude-from option of rsync to exclude files/folders from backup. It's mandatory to put something here but you can set a foo filename (a file that doesn't exists) if you don't want to exclude any file.
 
3.- Maximum number of incremental backups 
      MAXCOPIAS
    If its value is zero then there is no limit.
    When this number of backups is reached (except for zero) the "1" folder (the older one) is deleted to keep the maximum number of backups. Then, 2 is moved to 1, 3 is moved to 2, ... so that the resulting set of backups starts again in 1. The newest backups are preserved and the oldest is deleted.
    
4.- File with logs of the backup process
      LOGFILE
    It is recomended to use this value to keep the log file into the same folder that the backup:
      LOGFILE=$DESTINO_FS/$DESTINO_DIR/log.txt
